# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Aviv Jacubovski

I am a dedicated second-year computer science student at Ben-Gurion University with a GPA of 83 and a strong passion for problem-solving and technology. I am proficient in Java, C#, C++, Python, SQL, TypeScript and JavaScript, combining academic excellence with hands-on experience in software development.

My background includes serving as a combat medic in an elite IDF intelligence unit from 2019 to 2022, where I managed operational readiness and trained recruits, earning a certificate of excellence. Prior to that, I was a competitive judo athlete, ranking 7th in Israel, and I also coached young trainees.

I thrive under pressure, learn quickly, and enjoy tackling complex challenges. I am eager to expand my knowledge and contribute to innovative projects in the field of computer science.
